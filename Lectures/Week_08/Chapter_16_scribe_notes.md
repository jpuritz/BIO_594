#### How do populations with a climatic niche repsond to climate change phenotypic plasticty, adpataion, migration and extripation predictions and uncertainties of future climates

	How do we map the geohraphic distrubuions of suitbale cliamtic conditions for species populations 
		* GCMs (global climate models and bioclimatic envelope models and represtive pathways

#### Phenotypic plastisty

	Can be adaptive or maladaptive
	Short term effectiveness 
	Plays a role in genetic resuce
	Can help stdy gene expression and the abilty for organisms to tolerate climate veribilty
	Figure 16.1 - even with herability you can still go extict, no heribility results in extinction and with plascity you still have a decline in population size, so selection isnt suffient but you will recover just at a slower rate

#### Predictions of capacity for adaption
	
	Equation 16.1
	Predicts a species with a rmax of 0.5, trees would experience a higher rate of extinction 

#### Phenotypic approaches for detecting apadtion to climate change
	
	Animals model
	Reurrection studies
	Experimental evolution
	Space for time subsubsitions - usually takes years until reproductive maturaty

#### Species range shifts - models species distribution

	Species distribution models (SDMs)
		* advantage predictions indeepdent of current species distriutions
		* disadvantages does not include level genetic of demographic data and and results of SDMs change significantly when u 	include population data

#### Observed species range shifts

	Causes of lags in range shifts
		* dispersal lags
		* establishment lags
		* extinction lags

#### Extirpation and extinction
	extinction resistence - species with larger geographic ranges have lower extinctionrisks
		* rear edge populations
		* leading edge populations 

#### Management
	conservation stratergies
	protectadequare and appropiare space
	reduce non climatic stresses
	assisted migration
	assisted coloonization
	assisted gene flow

* Mikhail Matz's paper was brought up and we discussed assisted migration of corals in the carrbean
* Jon mention a debate on trnaslocation of eel grass that he was apart of and there was no real concenus from that discussion
* In terms of translocation of corals we don't have a great grasp of the genetic archtecture so it's best not to carry out such methods. Everytime we try to make things better by changing it we make it worst.
* We went over how to get to kitt and R
