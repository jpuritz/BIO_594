## Chapter 11 Quantitative Genetics 
### Polygenic
* Quantitative traits typically involve many genes
* Environment also has an effect on this
* Chapter goes over:
    * Genetic variation in quantitative traits 
    * Phenotypic variation 
    * How we can use these in models to explore natural population 
### Heritability 
* Quantitative traits include phenotypes that consist of continuous distributions 
* Although a lot of qualitative traitsa are polygenic, we don't know how many genes are involved from distribution of phenotypes

$V_a$ = Additive effects

$V_d$ = Dominance efftects 

$V_I$ = epistatic effects - interaction across multiple loci from chapter 10. Could be no interaciton or a lot of interaciton 
Above is a cocneptual and quantitative framework
* Phenotype is an expression of environment and genetics - nature and nurture 
* This can be broken down more with equation 11.2
* Once you get to a bunch of loci there is a more normal distribution and it is difficult to tell what is affecting a trait 
### Broad Sense Heritability 
* The proportion of phenotypic variaility that results from genetic difference among individuals

 ### Narrow Sense Heritability 
 * Predicts the response of a trait to selection 
 * More commonly used than broad-sense - in broad-sense, the prediction is not always great
 $H_N$ is the proportion of total phenotypic variation that is due only to additive genetic variation among 
 individuals.

 * Predicts the response of a trait to selection 
 * If H=1, completely heritable. Offspring look like parents 
 * If H=0, no heritability. Offspring go to mean of distribution

* S is difference between mean and quantitative trait you want to breed for 
* If all genetic variation is additive, then broad sense and narrow sense would be equal. 
* Papers typically discuss Narrow Sense. It is difficult to to Broad Sense. 
### Estimating Heritability 
* Can be used to estimate narrow sense

* In this figure, when slope was multiplied by two, this was used to estimate heritability

* Progeny testing estimated breeding value of parents with phenotypic similarities between hald or full offsprings 
* Example: Collect plans from outcrossing species. Seeds will have same mother but different father (1/2 sibs sharign 1/4 of genes from mother). $V_F$ Would be a quartre of additive variation as shown in equation. 
* Equation can be bias as it assumes half sibs. Could be not genetic aspects influencing phenotypic traits. 
### Genotype by environment interactions 
* We know the environment plays a role in the fitness of an organism
### Selection and Quantitative Traits 
* Narrow sense heritability can be estimated by an organism's response to selection

* S = selction 
* R = response 
* It s 1/3 beacuse it is the realized heritability already, it is fixed (In this example)
* The distance from the population mean can be changed
* Heritability = $\frac{R}{S}$
* Typically, you don't know $H_N$
* If $H_N$ = 0, you cannot select for that

* If there is no response to directional selection, heritability would be 0.

### Heritabilities and Allele Frequencies 
* Allele frequences can change even if the encironment is the same 
* In a single locus model, we can calculate heritability

* w is for fitness
* p and q are allele frequencies
