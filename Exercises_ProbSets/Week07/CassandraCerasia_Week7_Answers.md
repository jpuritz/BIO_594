| *Adh* Allele | *Eco*RI Allele | Individuals |Frequency|Frequency |Frequency|

| *Adh<sup>F</sup>* | *Eco*RI<sup>+</sup> | 22          |$G_1=(p_1)(p_2)$|$G_1=(0.7)(0.8)$|$G_1=0.6$|

$Allele Frequency = \frac{Number of Individuals}{Total}$

For $Adh^F$: $p_1=\frac{22+3}{22+4+3+5}$

$p_1=\frac{25}{34}$

$p_1=0.7$

For $EcoRI^+$: $p_2=\frac{22+4}{22+4+3+5}$

$p_2=\frac{26}{34}$

$p_2=0.8$

For $Adh^S$: $q_1=\frac{5+4}{22+4+3+5}$

$q_1=\frac{9}{34}$

$q_1=0.3$

For $EcoRI^-$: $q_2=\frac{5+3}{22+4+3+5}$

$q_2=\frac{8}{34}$

$q_2=0.2$

$D=(G_1\cdot G_4)-(G_2\cdot G_3)$

$D=(0.6\cdot 0.06)-(0.2\cdot 0.2)$

$D=(0.04)-(0.04)$

$D=0$

Since D = 0. the alleles are associated at random in the games and the population is in linkage equillibrium.

## 2. 
$D'= \frac{D}{Dmax}$

For AB:

$D=(G1\cdot G4)-(G2\cdot G3)$

$G_1$ = AB

$G_2$ = Ab

$G_3$ = aB

$G_4$ = ab

$D=(0.25* 0.25)-(0.25 *0.25)$

$D = 0.63 - 0.63$

$D = 0$

$ D' = \frac{D}{Dmax}$

$\frac {0}{0.25}=0$

For BC:

$D=(G1\cdot G4)-(G2\cdot G3)$

$G_1$ = BC

$G_2$ = Bc

$G_3$ = bC

$G_4$ = bc

$D=(0.25* 0.25)-(0.25 *0.25)$

$D = 0.63 - 0.63$

$D = 0$

$ D' = \frac{D}{Dmax}$

$\frac {0}{0.25}=0$

For AC: 

$D=(G1\cdot G4)-(G2\cdot G3)$

$G_1$ = AC

$G_2$ = Ac

$G_3$ = aC

$G_4$ = ac

$D=(0.5* 0.5)-(0 *0)$

$D = 0.25 - 0$

$D = 0.25$

$ D' = \frac{D}{Dmax}$

$\frac {0.25}{0.25}=1$

These results seem paradoxal because AB and BC are in gametic equillibrium while AC are not in gameitc equillibrium. This is paradoxial because I would assume them to be either all linked or none linked.

#### Population Total Work:
Pop 1: $720+180+80+20=1000$

Pop 2: $300+2700+700+6300=10,000$

Pop 3: $1020+2880+780+6320=11000$

Gamete Frequency = $\frac {Number Gametes}{Number Total Population}$

$G_1=$ Frequency of AB

$G_2=$ Frequency of Ab

$G_3=$ Frequency of aB

$G_4=$ Frequency of ab

* Population three is out of linkage equillibrium (D=0.035).

* When the two populations are pooled, given population three, it causes the populations to go out of linkage equillibrium as D is no longer equal to 0. The alleles at the two loci are therefore then not considered associated at random with respect to eachother. 

* D after 3 populations (using population 3): 

$D'=D(1-r)$ r = 0.1

Generation 1 is in the table above 

Generation 2: 

$D' = 0.035(1-0.1)$

$D' = 0.035(0.9)$

$D' = 0.031$

Generation 3: 

$D' = 0.031(1-0.1)$

$D' = 0.031(0.9)$

$D' = 0.028$

* No, this single episode of admixture cannot be detected in the population established from population three after two generations of random mating as the population is still in linkage disequillibrium. It cannot be detected in the genotype frequencies at the A/a or B/b locus after two generations of random mating. 

## 4. 
A phenotypic value of 130 is two standard deviations (standard deviation = 15) above the mean (mean = 100). Therefore, 2.3% of the population is expected to have a phenotypic value above 130. 

A phenotypic value of 85 is one standard deviation (standard deviation = 15) below the mean (mean = 100). Therefore, 15.87% of the population is expected to have a phenotypic value below 85.

A phenotypic value of 85 is one standard deviation (standard deviation = 15) below the mean (mean = 100). Therefore, 84.13% of the population is expected to have a phenotypic value below 85.

## 5. 
Since the value of the inbred population is 10, this must mean that this is $V_E$ because in the inbred population, genetic differences among individuals were removed through inbreeding. 

$V_E=10$

$V_P$ would then be 40 as this is the whole pipulation variance value. 

$V_P=40$

$V_P=V_E+V_G$

$40 = 10 + V_G$

$30=V_G$

Genotypic variance = 30 days to maturation

Environmental variance = 10 days to maturation

$H^2=\frac{V_G}{V_P}$

$H^2=\frac{30}{40}$

$H^2=0.8$

Broad sense heritability = 0.8 days to maturation

If the two inbred lines were crossed, the predicted variance in days to maturation in the $F_1$ generation would be the same (10) becuase the inbred lines are already inbred and thus have no genetic variation to make this number fluxuate. 

## 6. 
The first set of offspring, which is $F_1$ would provide an estimate of environmental variance since it is the very first generation of inbred strains. 

The second set of offspring, which is $F_2$ would have its variance determined by both genetic variance ($V_G$) from recieving genetic information from the first generation, and environmental effects ($V_E$) by still being exposed to the environment. 

## 7. 

$F_1 = V_E = 1.46$ due to first generation

$F_2 = V_P = 5.97 = V_E + V_G$ now has environmental variance and genetic variance from previous population.

$5.97 = 1.46 + V_G$

$5.97-1.46 = V_G$

$4.51 = V_G$

The genotypic variance is 4.51 leaves per plant. The environmental variance is 1.46 per plant. 
$H^2=\frac{V_G}{V_P}$

$H^2=\frac{4.51}{5.97}$

$H^2=0.755$

The broad sense heritability os 0.755 leaves per plant.
