### Part 1: Sequencing Reads Probability

Given that we are genotyping a heterozygous individual with a 50% chance of sequencing either allele (A or G), we can calculate the probabilities for the sequencing reads in each set.

Set 1:

* All reads are identical, so the probability is straightforward:
  * Probability of reading A: 0.53=0.1250.53=0.125
  * Probability of reading G: 0.53=0.1250.53=0.125

Set 2:

* All reads are identical, similar to Set 1:
  * Probability of reading A: 0.55=0.031250.55=0.03125
  * Probability of reading G: 0.55=0.031250.55=0.03125

Set 3:

* One read has a SNP, so we need to consider different scenarios:
  * Probability of reading A in the SNP position and A in the other positions: 0.5×0.54=0.031250.5×0.54=0.03125
  * Probability of reading G in the SNP position and A in the other positions: 0.5×0.54=0.031250.5×0.54=0.03125
  * Probability of reading A in the SNP position and G in the other positions: 0.5×0.54=0.031250.5×0.54=0.03125
  * Probability of reading G in the SNP position and G in the other positions: 0.5×0.54=0.031250.5×0.54=0.03125

### Part 2: Population Genetics

A. Observed Genotype and Allele Frequencies:

* Given:
  * Genotype counts: SS (11), SS- (55), S-S- (61)
* Calculations:
  * Total individuals: 11 + 55 + 61 = 127
  * Allele counts:
    * S allele: 2×11+1×55=772×11+1×55=77
    * * allele: 2×61+1×55=1772×61+1×55=177
  * Allele frequencies:
    * �(�)=77127≈0.606f(S)=12777​≈0.606
    * �(−)=177127≈0.394f(−)=127177​≈0.394
* Therefore, observed genotype frequencies:
  * �(��)=11127≈0.087f(SS)=12711​≈0.087
  * �(��−)=55127≈0.433f(SS−)=12755​≈0.433
  * �(�−�−)=61127≈0.480f(S−S−)=12761​≈0.480

B. Expected Genotypic Frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg:

* Under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), genotype frequencies can be calculated:
  * �(��)=�(�)2f(SS)=f(S)2
  * �(��−)=2×�(�)×�(−)f(SS−)=2×f(S)×f(−)
  * �(�−�−)=�(−)2f(S−S−)=f(−)2
* Using observed allele frequencies:
  * �(��)≈0.6062≈0.368f(SS)≈0.6062≈0.368
  * �(��−)≈2×0.606×0.394≈0.478f(SS−)≈2×0.606×0.394≈0.478
  * �(�−�−)≈0.3942≈0.155f(S−S−)≈0.3942≈0.155

C. Chi-square Test for HWE Agreement:

* Calculate expected counts using HWE frequencies and compare them to observed counts.
* Use the chi-square test formula to determine the level of agreement between observed and expected frequencies.

### Part 3: SNP Genotype Frequencies

A. Observed Genotype and Allele Frequencies:

* Given:
  * Genotype counts: A/A (0), A/G (10), G/G (0)
* Calculations:
  * Total individuals: 0 + 10 + 0 = 10
  * Allele counts:
    * A allele: 2×10+0=202×10+0=20
    * G allele: 2×0+10=102×0+10=10
  * Allele frequencies:
    * �(�)=2020+10=0.667f(A)=20+1020​=0.667
    * �(�)=1020+10=0.333f(G)=20+1010​=0.333
* Therefore, observed genotype frequencies:
  * �(�/�)=010=0f(A/A)=100​=0
  * �(�/�)=1010=1f(A/G)=1010​=1
  * �(�/�)=010=0f(G/G)=100​=0

B. Expected Genotypic Frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg:

* Using observed allele frequencies:
  * �(�/�)=�(�)2=0.6672≈0.445f(A/A)=f(A)2=0.6672≈0.445
  * �(�/�)=2×�(�)×�(�)=2×0.667×0.333≈0.444f(A/G)=2×f(A)×f(G)=2×0.667×0.333≈0.444
  * �(�/�)=�(�)2=0.3332≈0.111f(G/G)=f(G)2=0.3332≈0.111
