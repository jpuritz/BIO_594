Follow the prompts and commands

[x] Exercise 2- Answer these challenges with one line of code
1. Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?
                                   Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

2. Print the first 5 lines of the third column of out.idepth in /home/BIO594/Exercises/Week_2
```
awk '{print $3}' out.idepth | head -n 5

MEAN_DEPTH
19.7475
19.8769
20.2284
19.4391
```
3. Print only the 19th line of the second column of out.idepth
```
awk 'NR==19 {print $2}' out.idepth

8428
```
4. Print how many individuals have a MEAN_DEPTH greater than 20.1
```
awk '$3 > 20.1 {count++} END {print count}' out.idepth

11
```
5. Print how many individuals have a MEAN_DEPTH greater than 20.1 but less than 20.25
```
awk '$3 > 20.1 && $3 < 20.25 {count++} END {print count}' out.idepth

6
```
7. Print the average MEAN_DEPTH
```
awk '{sum=sum+$3} END {print sum/NR}' out.idepth 

19.3738
```
