###BIO 594- Using genomic techniques to examine the evolution of populations ###

###Exercise 1: Understanding advanced UNIX command line programs

 Signed into KITT which switched the directory to the home directory. 

	[ffields@KITT ~]$ 

Typed in Linux.Ex which began the exercise. Followed the prompt and commands. Type Linux.Ex next to move foward in the command line

	[ffields@KITT ~]$ Linux.Ex
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ Linux.Ex next


Exercise 2- Answer these challenges with one line of code

Go to the home directory and open the folder sneaky found in Exercises

	[ffields@KITT ~]$ cd /home/BIO594/Exercises
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ ls
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ cd sneaky 
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ ls
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ less file

The contents in the sneaky file are 

```
Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,
Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill’d with the foolish,
Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)
Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew’d,
Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me,
Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,
The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?

                                       Answer.
That you are here—that life exists and identity,
That the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse.

Print the first 5 lines of the third column of out.idepth in /home/BIO594/Exercises/Week_2
* Current directory is /home/BIO594/Exercises/sneaky so go back one and open Week_2 folder

	[ffields@KITT ~]$ cd ..
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ cd Week_2
	[ffields@KITT ~]$ less out.idepth

First 5 lines of the third column of out.idepth

```
MEAN_DEPTH
 19.7475
 19.8769
 20.2284
 19.4391
 20.4425
```

Print only the 19th line of the second column of out.idepth

	8428

Print how many individuals have a MEAN_DEPTH greater than 20.1

	[ffields@KITT ~]$ 3 > 20 out.idepth

Permission denied so I did them manually

```

Print the average MEAN_DEPTH

	[ffields@KITT Week_2]$ awk '{sum=sum+$3} END {print sum/NR}' out.idepth
	19.3738
