1\. Q: What is the probability that a particular allele has at least one copy in the next generation? The surprising answer quickly becomes independent of population size as *N* becomes larger. (Hint: Use one minus the probability that the allele has no copies in the next generation and this equation: 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

p​​​​​​2 +2pq = 1- q​​​​​​2

=1- (0.5)2

=0.75

lim�→∞(1+�∗�)1�=��p​​​​​​2 +2pq = 1- q​​​​​​2

=1- (0.5)2

1−1/�

2.Q: Assuming that the actual size of the population in any year equals the effective population size in that year, estimate the average effective number over the entire 12-year period.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ne= all years added together

120.0030

Ne= 3935

3.Q: A dairy farmer has a herd consisting of 200 cows and 2 bulls. What is the effective population size?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ne=(4\*Nm\*Nf)/Nm+Nf)

Ne=4\*2\*200)/(2+22)

Ne=3.9% of populairton 

4.Q: A rare triggerplant from Australia (Stylidium coroniforme) has only five known populations (Coates 1992). One of these populations has been monitored for several years, and over five years in the early 1980s: 2, 3, 25, 32, and 86 plants were recoreded. Assuming Ne = Nc in that year, estimate Ne as well as the average Nc over this period. What biological principle is illustrated by this example?

Ne=Nc

Ne= 5.45

����1*Ne* 

Average NC=29.60.916*NC*

This data illustarates inbreeding depression.

A. Calculate the frequencies of the two alleles in each population

Allele Frequency = 2\*(NHomozygotes)+ (Nheterozygotes)/ 2\* total individuals
