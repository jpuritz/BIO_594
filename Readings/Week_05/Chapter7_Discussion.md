# Chapter 7 Discussion Points

### Summary Questions: 
1. How does effective population size (*N<sub>e</sub>*) impact the genetic diversity of a population. What are some potential consequences for its long-term viability in conservation efforts?
2. What are the challenges conservation genetecists face when estimating *N<sub>e</sub>* in real world populations? 
3. How does knowledge of effective population size inform conservation strategies? Can we identify populations at higher risk of inbreeding? 
4. What implications might the observed sex ratios in lion populations have on their effective population size? Ne not likley > 2N (N = # rarer sex)


### Extension Questions: 
5. How might a small *N<sub>e</sub>* limit a populations ability to adapt to new environmental pressures? 
6. Is it reasonable/feasible/ethical to genetically monitor populations? At what point are we interfearing too much in natural processes?
